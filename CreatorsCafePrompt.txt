🎨 ART DIRECTION (STRICT)

Theme:
Ultra-premium dark cinematic startup aesthetic.

Color System:
• Background: Deep charcoal / near black (#0B0B0F or similar)
• Primary accent: Neon purple (#7F5AF0)
• Secondary accent: Electric blue (#00F5FF)
• Subtle gradients blending both
• Use color sparingly and intentionally

Design Principles:
• Massive negative space
• Intentional asymmetry in some sections
• Strong typography contrast
• Layered backgrounds (noise texture, gradient mesh, soft radial glow)
• Avoid visual noise
• Avoid cheap glow spam
• Avoid generic UI kit look

Typography:
Suggest and implement premium Google Font pairing.
Use:
• Bold large display font for headlines
• Clean modern sans-serif for body

Create strong scale difference between:
Hero headline
Section headings
Body text
Micro text

🎬 MOTION SYSTEM (GSAP REQUIRED)

Motion must feel:
• Expensive
• Smooth
• Controlled
• Intentional
• Not flashy

Implement:

Hero Intro Timeline

Background glow fade in

Headline word-by-word stagger

Subtext fade slide

CTA buttons reveal

Subtle floating background motion

Scroll-based Animations (ScrollTrigger)

Section fade + translate reveal

Parallax depth effect on backgrounds

Stagger reveal for feature blocks

Micro Interactions

Button hover subtle scale + glow shift

Card hover subtle 3D tilt effect

Magnetic button effect (optional)

Smooth scroll behavior

Animation durations must feel natural (0.6s–1.2s range).
Avoid aggressive bounce easing.

High-end startup showcase.

It must NOT feel like an AI-generated template.

Make it visually striking, modern, cinematic, and investor-ready.
